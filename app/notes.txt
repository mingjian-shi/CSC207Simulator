    the screen.

    setting the location for newly created Books. Called by the createBooks method in BookManager.
    Added getters for height and width of Book.

Ying:
    Added comment to SettableActivity for where a block of code was referenced from.
Ying:
    Code Affected: SettableActivity.java and SetupActivity.java
    Flaw: SettableActivity has redundant variables currColor and currLanguage. Setup already has
    these as attributes, and changes to language and background color should also be applied to
    Setup.
    Fix: Reformatted SettableActivity and SetupActivity to use Setup's attributes.

Ying:
    Code Affected: LoginActivity.java, NewaccountActivity.java, Setup.java, SettableActivity.java

    where other classes did not reflect the change.

    Fix: Changed the above mentioned methods to agree with changes to the game one that will come
    later.
Ying:
    Code Affected: Book.java, BookManager.java, BookSetter.java
    Flaw: Previous algorithm to position the Books contained a bug that did not account for a vacant
    spot between two Books.
    Fix: introduced id attribute to Book, and bookIds attrivute to BookManager to keep track of where
    Books are located on the screen. Modified affected code to adapt to these changes.
